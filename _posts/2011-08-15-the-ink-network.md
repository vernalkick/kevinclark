title: The Ink Network
---

I collect things every day — inspiration, articles, photos, quotes, links — but I rarely take the time to go back to those to get something out of them. It’s like that room filled with stuff you’ll never need but you keep anyways. I remember, as a kid, loving to go back in there and spending hours re-discovering stuff I didn’t even remember being there in the first place. The internet does a very good job of letting you aggregate stuff, but is very bad at making a good use of it.

Steve Jobs once said: “[You can’t connect the dots looking forward, you have to look backwards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA).” We should learn to look back to try to get someting out of everything we’ve shared (or collected). That’s where social networks should focus their attention.

Before social networks, amassing stuff we liked or thoughts we wrote down on pieces of paper wasn’t fun or cool. The magic part happens when you forget about it. You let it sink, and one day you find it back and you remember. That’s what’s truly awesome. All the feelings, emotions suddenly come back.

The internet forgets stuff. Bytes get deleted, things don’t stay there indefinitely. Web pages are easily ignorable, and don’t take any space. That’ why the web is great, and that’s how you’d want it to be.

But sometimes, you wish you could physically feel it.  What if we could gather all of your followers in the same room? What if we could print every web page ever created?

What if we had a physical social network? An *ink* network?

You could throw it away somewhere in your house and never look back at it for some time, but it would pop back up whether you wanted it or not. And when it does, you’re forced to stop everything you’re doing, sit back and go through it all over again.

It’s almost like paper and ink create eternity. I know it’s not always the case, but a book can be read a hundred times and can be passed from generation to generation. It is also more precious. There are things I like so much that I want to own them. Words written in a book also usually have more impact than words in a blog. It’s all kinds of false, but it’s true at the same time.

I want my stuff to stay. I want to come back to it later. What you’re reading now will be a book. A real thing you can put on your shelf. I am going to select my best articles and have them printed to keep them forever. It will be better than any social network. It’s going to be *me*.
