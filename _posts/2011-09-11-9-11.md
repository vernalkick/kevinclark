Everyone knows what they were doing when it happened. I was coming back from school for dinner and when I came outside, my mother was waiting for me.

She then announced me the terrible news. I did understand the words she was saying, but it seemed as real as a movie is. I saw the images and immediately thought about how the special effects looked real. But this time, there was no post production tricks. It was all real. I saw people suffering and crying, but I didn’t feel that much sadness. I didn’t get what that meant, how much this moment changed the lives of thousands of people. That this moment was going to be in history books from now on.

And I didn’t feel it. I felt sadder when one of my favourite TV show ended. I connected more to fictionnal people than real humans. For a long time I didn’t know why, but now I know. People mean nothing without stories. You truely empathize with someone when you know their motivations, their aspirations, their dreams, their imperfections, their fears. So maybe the news should be a little more like a TV show. You start to feel like you know personally this person it’s happening to (or it’s family) and then you can fully understand the implications of such a disaster.

What I really want to say is, it doesn’t matter what you were doing when it happened. All that matters is what happened *after*. It brought people together. For once, everyone was unified by a terrible event (yes), but they had a point in common. They were not alone. You never are, but we’re all akind to forget it easily. People die. Shit happens. What matters is how you deal with it.
