<a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a> is doing to iTunes what iTunes did to CDs. Managing music between two Macs, iPhones and iPads is a mess, and as much as the iTunes store was revolutionary when it came out, it’s now as cumbersome to me as the CD ever was.

### The rise of mobile devices

I’m on my iPhone more than 80% of the time and having to go to the “store” to buy music feels ancient. I have to find the song I’m looking for, listen to it to make sure it’s OK, tap buy, enter my password, wait for it to download, go back to the music app, find the song, press play.

This is not what I call “simple”. It 2013, I shouldn’t have to worry about files anymore. Managing music is a thing of the past and we have to move forward.

### Music is ephemeral

Music genres come and go, and my musical tastes today do not resemble the ones I had even a few years ago. I don’t think I should *own* music. I just want to listen to it easily without having to worry about anything. To me, [accessibility trumps ownership](http://frankchimero.com/writing/2011/making-the-bed-you-sleep-in/).

I feel like *owning* music puts to much of a burden on me to buy only “good” music. I know that’s stupid, but because of that I’m giving up on music that aren’t as mainstream and obvious. A subscription model makes me feel like I can listen to whatever I happen to want to listen to at the moment, without having to worry about owning it forever.

<mark>So, I signed up for <a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a>. And I like it a lot.</mark>

<hr>

<p><small>One minor gripe I have about <a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a> is the few songs that aren't in their catalog. I’ve resigned myself not to listen to these songs at all, but it would be nice if they had something similar to iTunes Match where you could upload the songs you’ve bought that are not in their catalog and play them through the service. But overall, I’m listening to more music and I’m happy to say goodbye to iTunes.</small></p>
