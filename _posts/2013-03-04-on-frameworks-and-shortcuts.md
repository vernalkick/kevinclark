<small><span>Disclamer:</span> You should take this article with a grain of salt. I am very aware that not all developers are like this.</small>

Recently, a few of my developer friends tweeted about a "Flat" UI kit and how it was awesome with [Bootstrap][Bootstrap]. I've been thinking about this for a while and I really think this is a problem that should be adressed.

## Developers, please. Design is not something you tack on at the end to make things look pretty. Designers do not have a magic wand that spits out buttons.

UI Kits like this one [trick developers into thinking design is merely aesthetics][Design is not veneer]. It is not. Using a "flat" style (note that I didn't use the word "design") does not automatically make good design.


Developers, if you want to get better at design, this is *not* the way to go. Like learning a new programing language, there's no shortcut to learn design. Don't try to find a good framework, or boilerplate, or any *premade reusable kit*. These will make everything you make look the same and be incredibly boring. And we're just talking about aesthetics. Instead of worrying about how your buttons should look, why don't you worry about your information architecture? How does you site work on mobile? And how about having a clear text hirearchy? These things are way more important to worry about than *style*.

Sometimes (I'd even say always), the only way to do something right is to do it the [long, hard, stupid way][Video Frank Chimero]. Design is definitely one of those things.

There is no process to do the thinking for you. There is no recipe to building great products. And that's OK.

Now, leave Twitter Bootstrap & UI Kits alone and <mark>start building things</mark>. You're going to learn a whole heck of a lot more and the result will just be more unique and have more [soul][Noah's Branch discussion].

As [designers become more and more able to code][David's post on Medium], developers feel like they have to step into design too to stay competitive. I think we both have a lot to gain from that, even if that just means knowing a little more what happens on the other side.

And if you want to learn design and don't know where to start, [shoot me an email](mailto:kevin@kevinclark.ca) and I'll help you.

I think this topic is part of a larger discussion on how designers and developers should learn to work together and I'd like to hear your opinion on the matter in this branch discussion.
