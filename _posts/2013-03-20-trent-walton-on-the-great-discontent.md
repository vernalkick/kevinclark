[The Great Discontent](http://thegreatdiscontent.com), one of my favorite websites recently [interviewed Trent Walton](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/trent-walton), a big inspiration for me. The whole thing is chock-full of great advice and great insight into Trent's carrer.

He has an interesting take on formal design education:

> I studied psychology and child and family development. Even so, I always found a way to volunteer for design work through various campus groups I was part of, but I was never formally trained in design. I like the idea of being self-taught when it comes to the web because it almost creates a desperation and resourcefulness—and sometimes, insecurity—that I might not otherwise have. I often think, “Man, maybe there’s a lesson they teach you on the third week of design class that I don’t know. I could really embarrass myself someday.” The idea that I’ve missed something has kept me on my toes and maybe I use that to my advantage.

Anyways, the whole thing is well worth a read. [Check it out!](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/trent-walton)
