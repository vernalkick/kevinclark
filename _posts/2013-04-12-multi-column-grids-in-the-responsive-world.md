Responsive design is getting a lot more common these days, and even though some of us are starting to get a hang of it, we're all pretty much *experimenting* with our process and making things up as we go.

Don't get me wrong, Responsive Web Design is **hard**, but I think it made us a bit lazy. Single columns websites are starting to resurface and although it can sometimes be really appropriate, I feel like it lacks interestingness (or [soul][1] if you want to call it that) and more often than not, it's just boring.

And when I'm refering to "single column websites" I'm not talking about websites that have no sidebar, I'm speaking of websites that only have a single column of text that spans the whole width of the website. To make that more clear, let's look at [Jeffrey Zeldman's website][2].

Although there is nothing inheritently wrong with that design (and I have the utmost respect for [Jeffrey][2]), you can't say that it brings much visual interest. It's a good starting point, but I believe we should consistently try to push the boundaries of what's possible with HTML and CSS.

I'm one of those people who think we still have lots to learn from print design, so whenever I see a (design) problem with the web, I turn myself to the print industry.

Magazines take layouts very seriously: you often have multiple columns, images bleeding to the sides, pull quotes, side notes in the margins or [Tombstones][4] signifying the end of an article. These element are nice visual touches that will make a significant impact on the reading experience. A great example of these principles put in use is the newly launched [Wired website][3].

### Missing the point

The underlying concept behind responsive web design is to adapt the design of the website to take advantage of the perks of different screen sizes.

## Having a one-column website that just scales the font-size up to accomodate for larger screens misses the point because it forgets the larger viewports in favor of a one-size-fits-all approach.

We're all figuring this out as we go, but I hope this trend is just a byproduct of us getting used to a whole new world where we have to take into consideration different contexts. Yes, some things be harder to pull off using percentages and fluid grids, but it's part of the challenge of making a responsive website. Don't give up on a layout because it's hard to implement. Don't let the tools rule what you do, [adapt][8] the tools to do what you want.
