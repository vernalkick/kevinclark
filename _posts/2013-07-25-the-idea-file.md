I've been slowly trying to get back to writing after a hectic past couple of weeks, and getting back in the groove hasn't been as easy as I thought.

Ideas are sneaky; they always come up to you in the most impractical times. When you've just entered the shower, during the longest meeting, on a walk in the middle of the day, when you're at the restaurant with friends, etc. The problem is that they also always *disappear* as quickly as they came. So, you have to be ready when that moment of wisdom strikes. That’s why I’ve decided to keep an [idea file][idea file]. I write down every single thought that comes up to me no matter how stupid it may sound or what I’m doing. The goal here isn’t to elaborate on the idea, but to record it before you forget it.

I just use the notes app on my iPhone, iPad and Mac for that. It’s simple, it syncs on all my devices and I can even add to it with Siri when I’m driving.

About once a week, I try to go through the list and look for [connections][connect the dots], a new perspective that allows me to view a situation from another angle. Only then I try to write a piece to express my thoughts more clearly. Sometimes that results in a discussion with a couple of friends, sometimes it results in an article on this very site, or a new side project.

That’s the exact same trick song writers use when they write songs: they collect phrases that sound good to them and assemble it into a full-on piece later. In the design world, that's the equivalent of an inspiration folder, but for thoughts and ideas.

I've just started doing this seriously and I'm already seeing the results.
