I’m excited to hear that early preview copies of [Digest](http://readdigest.com/) are landing on lucky readers’ doorsteps. Digest is a new A3-sized magazine by <a href="http://viewportindustries.com/about">Elliot Jay Stocks and Keir Whitaker</a>, described as “a seasonal digest of culture that surrounds the world of the creative professional; a lifestyle publication that provides inspiration for the discerning traveller; a reminder that the world away from our computers is ripe for exploration.”

The best part is that Elliot and Keir kindly invited me to contribute an article to the debut issue, so I penned a few words about my favourite places in New York City; a city a love and visit often.

Head over to [the magazine’s site](http://readdigest.com/), where you can buy the magazine either in print or digital form.
