	<figcaption>Last year we changed our website every month. It was fun, educational and just a little bit exhausting. Mostly it was fun though. In order to give ourselves a broader platform this year, we’ve created this section, for experiments, ideas and projects.</figcaption>

<p>Many of you will have heard of <a href="#">Codex: the journal of typography</a>, the forthcoming publication from iLT’s John Boardley, and the good news is that pre-orders for #1 are opening later today. This thing is going to sell like hot cakes.</p>

<p>I was humbled when John asked me to write an article for the debut issue — a detailed account of the design decisions that went into the production of 8 Faces and my personal journey from web to print — and, as such, I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing part of the magazine’s creation and the pleasure of working with the first-class editorial team of John, old friend Cary Wood, and 8 Faces contributor Allen Tan.</p>

<h2>In closing</h2>

<p>By the way, the line-up is incredible. Whose names spring to mind when you say the word ‘typography’? People like Erik Spiekermann, Christian Schwartz, Paul Barnes, Craig Mod, and Stephen Coles? Well, they’re in there, and with a whole load more, too.</p>
