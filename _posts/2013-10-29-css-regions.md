<p>Since <a href="http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/hello-typekit/">joining the ranks of Adobe</a>, I’ve been lucky enough to get sneak peeks at early betas and access to the folks building some of these exciting new tools. The <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/">Edge</a> team, like Typekit, seem to enjoy a degree of autonomy that allows them to work on some seriously boundary-pushing new apps, and lately they’ve been showing me what they’ve been up to with <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/reflow/">Edge Reflow</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">CSS</span> Regions</h2>
<p>I’ve been excited about <a href="http://html.adobe.com/webplatform/layout/regions/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Regions</a> for quite some time. Not only will they play a huge part in making responsive designs more robust, but they also enable web designers to flow content in a print-like manner — if you’ve ever used InDesign to flow a Story over several text boxes, you’ll get the idea. As <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-regions/">the W3C spec</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <span class="caps">CSS</span> regions module allows content to flow across multiple areas called regions. The regions are not necessarily contiguous in the document order. The <span class="caps">CSS</span> regions module provides an advanced content flow mechanism, which can be combined with positioning schemes as defined by other <span class="caps">CSS</span> modules.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the latest version of Reflow, <span class="caps">CSS</span> Regions are baked right in. Here’s a quick video walkthrough from <a href="http://twitter.com/jacobsurber">Jacob</a>.</p>

<p>There’s more information on <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/edgereflow/2013/09/24/the-future-of-responsive-layouts-is-here/">the Reflow blog</a> and <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2013/09/23/design-next-generation-responsive-designs-for-ios7-with-edge-reflow-cc-and-css-regions-a-story-of-collaboration/">the Web Platform team’s blog</a>. I thoroughly recommend reading them for the full details.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">CSS</span> Filters</h2>
<p>While we’re on the subject of experimental <span class="caps">CSS</span> features, <a href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/code/">Edge Code</a> — the code editor built by the Edge team — has a number of them built in as well, in addition to <span class="caps">CSS</span> Regions (<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/edgecode/2013/09/24/edge-code-supports-css-regions/">here’s how you use <span class="caps">CSS</span> Regions in Edge Code</a>). <a href="http://html.adobe.com/webplatform/graphics/customfilters/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Filters</a> (graphical filters in the Photoshop sense) are now available to use in the latest build, and you might be surprised to know that they work in the latest versions of Chrome and Safari (including iOS 7 Safari).</p>
<h2>Reflow / Photoshop sync</h2>
<p class="note left">Editorially co-founder and STET editor Mandy Brown worked with Robin Sloan to edit The Wrong Plane. Here she asks a few questions about the writing process, the size and scope of an edit, and the vocabulary of bird collisions.</p>
<p>Jumping back to Reflow, the latest build now sports some extremely useful integration with Photoshop. At this point I’ll be honest and admit that for a long time I wondered how the app could fit into my workflow, given that I usually jump back and forth between Photoshop and hand-coding during the design process (I’ll probably blog about this properly at some point, but for now it’s safe to say that I share <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/the-post-psd-era/">Dan Mall’s opinion</a> on this sort of design process), but given Reflow’s recent updates and what I’m about to show you, it’s clear that it’s become a real web design application.</p>

<p>In essence this means I can move my loose design ideas straight over into Reflow without needing to start a new Reflow project from scratch, and in my mind that’s a massive hurdle that’s just been removed. You can get the full details in <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/edgereflow/2013/09/09/photoshop-reflow/">the Edge team’s blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, in case you missed it: <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/photoshopdotcom/2013/09/introducing-adobe-generator-for-photoshop-cc.html">you can now generate assets from Photoshop just by naming your layers</a>. That’s pretty cool, isn’t it?</p>
<p>You can get all this awesome new stuff from <a href="http://creative.adobe.com/">creative.adobe.com</a>.</p>
