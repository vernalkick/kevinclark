At Shopify we either go big or go home. Well for this (official) Dribbble meetup, we decided to go all in. Dan Cederholm and Frogandcode are coming down to Toronto to host a night of design, drinking and networking.

Since I wouldn't miss this event for anything, I'll be flying down to Toronto to attend. I hope to see you there, and if you see me, please come and say hi!
