Last week, [Kevin Systrom](http://instagram.com/kevin) introduced a new key feature in [Instagram][1] that lets you send pictures directly to specific users of the service, adding a layer of privacy that's completely new to the service.

It is undoubtedly a response to the huge success of Snapchat (which kind of reminds me of [Instagram][1] when it started), but something caught my attention during the presentation:

> What a lot of people associate with us is beautiful photography. And a new way to communicate and share in the real world doesn’t exactly strike a chord with beautiful photography. They seem a little disparate. But what I want to do today is talk about how they’re not so different. And in fact how they’re really close. For us communication is really core.

> It’s not about photography necessarily. If we were about photography we’d be built into cameras, but we’re not built in to cameras, we’re built into phones.

<p class="note right"><a href="http://dustincurtis.com/">Dustin Curtis</a> <a href="http://dcurt.is/the-life-of-dustin-curtis">has been thinking about this idea</a> for a while now. Interesting to see Instagram moving in that direction.</p>

I’ve seen myself times and times again, refraining from posting an image on [Instagram][1] because it wasn’t visually interesting enough or because the lighting wasn’t perfect. I think [Instagram][1] became a victim of the incredible pace at which camera technology in smartphones improves year over year. They imagined a future where cameras became phones, not phones becoming cameras and I feel like they were genuinely surprised by how people used their app to make art.

Well, this is [Instagram][1] stripping the art *out* of the equation, educating users to tell a story *through* images to communicate with each other. This is [Instagram][1] saying that images are not the end result, they’re a vessel through which you can describe things that no words can describe. It marks an important shift in direction for them and I think it’s going to be an interesting one to watch.
