  <figcaption>I just received the new issue of the .net Magazine in the mail today. I sat down with Martin Cooper from .net Magazine about a couple weeks ago to give an extensive interview.</figcaption>

Spread over four pages this was definitely one of the longest interviews I gave so far and I'm honored having it with one of the biggest print magazines in our web industry.

Mainly I talked about some of my recent projects, being self-taught, how to deal with critique & how to give/receive good feedback as well as what inspires & motivates me.

I definitely enjoyed giving this interview. If you're interested, the .net magazine should be available at most bookstores that sells english magazines.

Or just order online at netmagazine.com
