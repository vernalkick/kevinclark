Dan Rubin in [a video for Observer Tech Monthly][video]:

> Chaining multiple apps together [is] the best way of taking advandage of what these little devices are capable of. Rather than just shooting with the default camera and being content with that image, use all of these apps that are at your disposal to make the absolute best image possible.

Great list of apps and tips if, like me, your iPhone *is* your one and only camera. I'm definitely going to be buying these three apps:

- [Average Cam Pro]() automatically takes multiple pictures, calculates the average picture out of these and normalizes the result, to create the best long exposure shot.
- [Cortex Camera]() combines dozens of images to create a sharp image without the low-quality noise that you get when using the default camera.
- [Touch Retouch]() lets you remove unwanted content or objects from your photos with your fingers.
