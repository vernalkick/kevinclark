It's no secret that I'm a complete sucker for [Tungsten][Tungsten][^1]. It might very well may be one of my favorite typeface ever made. It's nice to see [Hoefler & Co][hfj][^2] add new styles to their iconic typefaces. Hopefully a non-condensed version of Tungsten is coming next.

[^1]: I've been using Tungsten Semi-Bold in my logo for years now. Still looks as good.
[^2]: Still not getting used to it.
