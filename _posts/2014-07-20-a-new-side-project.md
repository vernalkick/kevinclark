I'm going to try to write a real app this time. I have this idea for an app that I think would be pretty useful to me. I don't want to reveal too much about it yet, but the design work is 75% done and I'm happy with it.

It's also going to be written completely in Swift. I know that a lot of people are advising against it. I don't care. It's a personal project, I have no deadlines, no existing codebase and no allegiance to Objective-C. I've played with Swift quite a bit recently and I really like it. It feels a lot more natural to write than Objective-C and I like the fact that I'm learning this language at the same time as thousands of people. I'm also convinced that Swift is the way forward, so why wait?[^1]

I'll talk about it in more details as I get closer to Beta, but if youâ€™re interested [you should follow me on Twitter][twitter]. I'll try to [keep writing about my process][articles] too, so keep an eye out for new posts soon.

[^1]: One thing that sucks for people writing Swift code is that the Xcode 6 beta is extremely buggy. I'm staying on beta 3 for now since it seems relatively stable for me, but definitely something to consider when thinking of starting a new project in Swift today.
