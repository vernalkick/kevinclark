[We've][Shopify] recently teamed up with [Dribbble][Dribbble] for an [official playoff][Playoff] centered around the theme of "What Does Design Mean to You?" To choose the main shot we had an internal competition to determine who came up with the most interesting shot. I didn't win unfortunately, but Paul Pritchard wrote [an excellent article][Paul's article] about the design process behind his winning shot. Well worth a read.

There's still time to [enter the playoff][Playoff] (you could win really cool prizes). The contest ends Tuesday, August 5th. Can't wait to see what design means to you.
