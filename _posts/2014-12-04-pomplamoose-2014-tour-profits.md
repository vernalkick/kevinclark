Jack Conte, CEO of Patreon and musician in the band Pomplamoose [shared the profits of their 2014 tour on Medium][medium]. In short, unless you're a super star it's really hard to make money from touring alone.

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re entering a new era in history: the space between “starving artist” and “rich and famous” is beginning to collapse. YouTube has signed up over a million partners (people who agree to run ads over their videos to make money from their content). The “creative class” is no longer emerging: it’s here, now.</p>
  <p>We, the creative class, are finding ways to make a living making music, drawing webcomics, writing articles, coding games, recording podcasts. Most people don’t know our names or faces. We are not on magazine covers at the grocery store. We are not rich, and we are not famous.</p>
  <p>We have not “made it.” We’re making it.</p>
</blockquote>

I see a huge parallel between indie artists and indie developers. Making a living off of selling apps alone may be becoming harder and harder, but you certainly can do really well selling some of your own apps, doing contract work, writing and speaking at conferences.
