[Ustwo](http://ustwo.com), makers of the beautiful [Monument Valley](https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?mt=8&path=apps%2fmonumentvalley) recently partnered with Google to [design a few watch faces](http://wear.ustwo.com) for [Android Wear](http://www.android.com/wear/). They did an excellent job at not only displaying time in a way that is visually interesting, but also reinventing how a watch should tell time. For example, one of the watch face only shows you the time left until your next appointment, allowing you to focus on *what* you have to do, instead of *when*.

As we've come to expect, this is top notch work. I recommend watching the video to see how they approached the problem.
