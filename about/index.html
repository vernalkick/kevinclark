    <p>From the outside, the design process looks like a giant black box. Designers often don't want you to see into that box because they're afraid you're going to know they have no idea of how it's going to look like, or how it's going to work. To be a great designer you have to consider every possibility. And we might not know where we're going, but we know we'll get there. Every time I get there. You just have to let yourself the chance.</p>

    <p>Everything has been designed. From the computer screen you're reading this on to the watch you're wearing. We're humans, we make things. I believe design can make people's lives better. Design is a sign that people care. And that's just what the world needs. I may be trying to infer too much meaning into what is basically just pixels, but it never hurts to know that it's people all the way down, not users or eyeballs, real people like you and me.</p>
