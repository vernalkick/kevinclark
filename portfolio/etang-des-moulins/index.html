    <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
    <h3>With about half of their traffic coming from mobile devices, it was obvious that the new site should be built using responsive design techniques. We adopted a device agnostic approach, adding breakpoints to optimize the design for a multitude of viewports.</h3>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <h3>We needed to find typefaces that would evoke the ones used in the logo, but that would modernize the style of the site to make it more appealing to younger people. We settled on Proxima Nova for the body text and Rouge Script to bring a little personality to the headers.</h3>

    <h2>A huge time saver</h2>
    <h3>The main goal of this project was to offload a lot of the tasks that previously took a lot of time on the owners to the website. We did that by allowing people to easily see events happening, look at the menu and book a reservation straight from the site.</h3>
