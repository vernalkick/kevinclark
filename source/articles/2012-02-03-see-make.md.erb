I see things. But I’d like to see more. The biggest misconception about what differentiates creatives from non-creatives is that we have a better ability to make things.

We see things. That’s what makes us really special. Mostly it’s just small details that don’t matter for normal people, but somehow, for me it’s awesome.I can’t count how many times I’ve stopped to take a picture of a signage because I admired the typography, or the colors used. Thousands of people pass by this sign everyday and don’t even look at it. Are they blind? No, they *just don’t care*.

I care. The more you understand the greatness of something, the more you’re able to recreate the feelings it gives.
