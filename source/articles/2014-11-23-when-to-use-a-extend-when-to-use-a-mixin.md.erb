Harry Roberts wrote [a great post on CSS Wizardry][post] about the distinction between `@extend` and `@mixin`:

> Only use @extend when the rulesets that you are trying to DRY out are inherently and thematically related. Do not force relationships that do not exist: to do so will create unusual groupings in your project, as well as negatively impacting the source order of your code.

> Use a mixin to either inject dynamic values into repeated constructs, or as a Sassy copy/paste which allows you to repeat the same group of declarations throughout your project whilst keeping a Single Source of Truth.

I completely agree with it. In real life, that means I almost never use `@extend`s. If you have a lot of elements that share the same styles for a reason, you should probably make it a class on its own.
