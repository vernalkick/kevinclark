You've read that right, [Apple recently updated the Apple Watch design resources to include Sketch files](https://twitter.com/rafahari/status/543333621420261376) (alongside the Photoshop version). It's impressive how an app by such a small team (compared to Adobe) could rise so quickly to being the gold standard for UI design. It really goes to show how great of a piece of software it is[^1]. I also feel like we're at a turning point. Unless Adobe does a complete 180 on its product stategy and focuses on what customers really want, the ship has sailed. Photoshop will just keep loosing relevance amongst designers.

[^1]: Plus, I'm sure Apple really likes the fact that it's only available for OS X.
