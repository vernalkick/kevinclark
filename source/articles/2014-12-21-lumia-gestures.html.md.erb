[Microsoft recently announced Gestures for Lumia phones](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lumia_beta_apps/archive/2014/12/15/manage-calls-more-naturally-with-gestures-beta-try-it-out-and-give-us-feedback.aspx), which are basically shortcut gestures for things you commonly do when talking on the phone. I like how each of these gestures simply build upon things you'd already do. Very clever. I would love to see these come to iOS.
