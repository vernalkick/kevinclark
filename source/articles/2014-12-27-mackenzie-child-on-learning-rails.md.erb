Here's [another great example of a designer learning the basics of Rails for fun][post]:

> I always had ideas I wanted to bring to life, but I didn’t have the money to hire a developer, or know how to build them out myself. I’ve always loved the idea of taking a concept of mine from design, to front-end code, to back-end all myself.

I love that attitude. Don't depend on other people to realize your ideas, own the whole process from start to finish.

To challenge himself, he decided to [record 12 video tutorials][post], building a different project each time. It might be a good place to start if you want to start learning.
