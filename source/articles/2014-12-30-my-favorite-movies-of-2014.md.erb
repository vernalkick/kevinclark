As we approach the end of 2014, I thought it'd be a good idea to list out the movies I have watched this year that I've enjoyed the most. This is by no means an exhaustive list and it's ranked in no particular order.

### The Grand Budapest Hotel

God I love this movie. Every shot has been carefully crafted by Wes Anderson to tell a wonderful story. While watching the movie, you can experience Anderson's universe and be a part of it for a moment.

### Enemy

Upon first watch, this movie makes no sense, but the ending kept me thinking. I ended up watching this video on YouTube that explains the movie, and once you understand all the references, this movie is genius. A must watch.

### Gone Girl

Fantastic movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The ending is beautifully unexpected and shows some great acting by Ben Affleck. I wish I could re-live the first time I watched this movie.

### Guardians of the Galaxy

While it's definitely not in the same category as some of the other movies mentioned previously, it was just a really fun action movie. It reminds me in a way of the first Star Wars. I'll be looking forward to the next one.

At this point you must be wondering why Interstellar isn't there. From what I've heard it's really great, but I haven't had the time to watch it yet. If I did watch it, I'm sure it would be up there. Any other movies that slipped under my radar this year? [Let me know!](https://twitter.com/vernalkick)
