I recently wrote about my what my ideal setup for this website would be. Back then, I described it as

> A static Jekyll site with a companion iOS app that uses the Github API to publish posts from my iPhone and iPad without having to edit the files directly.

Well, that's exactly what I ended up doing. So here's the full workflow.

## The iOS app

The iOS app uses Github's content API, which gives you a fairly easy way of reading and updating files from any Github repository.

I wrote the app completely in Swift (of course) in about three days. There's still a bunch of things I want to improve, but I got pretty far. It allows me to post new articles, edit existing ones, preview drafts and has markdown syntax highlighting.
