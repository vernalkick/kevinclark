[Jonathan Mann](https://twitter.com/songadaymann), famous for his song-a-day project recently [made this video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=_8M6nEMVVOk)[^1] telling the story of Jack Dolsen, a guy who decided to parody Jonathan's work. Instead of making a song a day, he would find a new excuse every day for *not* singing.

What's funny is that, making excuses for not doing something everyday takes as much time as just doing it. I won't spoil the ending of the video, but it teaches a great lesson that any kind of creative person should learn.

[^1]: This also shows an interesting way of doing storytelling through videos online. I'd love to see more people take this approach.
