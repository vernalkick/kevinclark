Fantastic post over on Wired about [the thinking behind Disney's foray into wearables for Disneyland](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/disney-magicband/).

> It’s amazing how much friction Disney has engineered away: There’s no need to rent a car or waste time at the baggage carousel. You don’t need to carry cash, because the MagicBand is linked to your credit card. You don’t need to wait in long lines. You don’t even have to go to the trouble of taking out your wallet when your kid grabs a stuffed Olaf, looks up at you, and promises to be good if you’ll just let them have this one thing, please.

More and more, I'm starting to think that the real value in wearable isn't just quick access to your notifications, it's bridging the gap between the physical and digital world.
