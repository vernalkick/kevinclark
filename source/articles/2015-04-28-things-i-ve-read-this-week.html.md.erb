### [Frictionless Design Choices](http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2015/03/16/frictionless-design-choices/)

This post is by [Steven Sinofsky](https://twitter.com/stevesi), who previously led the Windows 7 product at Microsoft. In his article, he makes the distinction between minimalist design and frictionless design which really resonated with me:

> Frictionless and minimalism are related but not necessarily the same. Often they are conflated which can lead to design debates that are difficult to resolve.
>
> A design can be minimal but still have a great deal of friction. The Linux command line interface is a great example of minimal design with high friction. You can do everything through a single prompt, as long as you know what to type and when. The minimalism is wonderful, but the ability to get going comes with high friction. The Unix philosophy of small cooperating tools is wonderfully minimal (every tool does a small number of things and does them well), but the learning and skills required are high friction.
>
> Product managers need to choose features to add. That is what makes all of this so difficult. As great as it is to stay pure and within original intent, if you and the team don’t enhance the capabilities of your product then someone will do what you do, but with a couple of more things or a different factoring and you’ll be left in the dust.
>
> Therefore the real design challenge is not simply maintaining minimalism, but enhancing a product without adding more friction. Let’s assume you built a product that does something very exciting and has a very low friction to usage and does so with a minimal feature set. The next efforts are not about just watching your product, but about deciding how to address shortcoming, enhance, or otherwise improve the product to grow users, revenue, and popularity. The risk with every change is not simply failing to maintain minimalism, but introducing friction that becomes counterproductive to your goals.

He then goes on to list a few pieces of advice to achieve a design that’s as frictionless as possible. It’s really a terrific piece, if you only read one thing from this list, make it this one.

### [Colorless Adventures In The Colorful World](https://medium.com/@polarrist/colorless-adventures-in-the-colorful-world-e4a5036aa61d)

While a lot of us have been making efforts to design in such a way that our interfaces are just as usable for people with colour-blindness, I found it interesting to read about the perspective of a designer who is color-blind and that has to adjust in his work for people that can see the full color spectrum.

It made me wonder, do I know designers that are colour-blind? If so, I’d [love to hear](mailto:kevin@kevinclark.ca) more about what your biggest annoyances are, how we could do better in our interfaces and how being color-blind impacts your work.

### [Designing for Virtual Reality](https://medium.com/backchannel/immersive-design-76499204d5f6)

This article is about designing for VR devices and how it’s a fundamentally different paradigm that is less abstract, that users don’t need to learn how to use and that has a much lower cognitive load to making decisions. VR is still this mysterious thing to me, but I’m very fascinated by the way it’ll change how we interact with interfaces. With Responsive Web Design we started thinking about design in terms of screens of any shapes and sizes, but with VR we’re throwing out the idea of screens altogether. It’s an exciting time to be a designer.

### [Things do jobs](http://thingsdojobs.tumblr.com)

Fun photo Tumblr showing the iPhone next to the physical object it replaces. A good reminder of how everything is slowly turning into software. Lucky for us, we get to rethink these experiences (hopefully) for the better.

### [How will we behave around food in 2025?](http://www.conceptkitchen2025.com)

Speaking of technology infiltrating itself into just about everything, IKEA recently collaborated with IDEO and a few design students to design the kitchen of the future. I really liked seeing the different prototypes and how they focused on solving specific problems that we encounter every day. Even though some of these ideas sound crazy, I love that they’ve been given a lot of leeway to explore different ideas. I really hope we get to see some of these ideas become a reality in the near future.
