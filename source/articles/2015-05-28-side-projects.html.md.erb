I was recently [a guest on The Artboard][Artboard] to talk about side projects. Over the last few years I’ve had numerous side projects: [this site](http://kevinclark.ca), [MTL Dribbble Meetup](http://mtldribbblemeetup), [Tipsy](http://kevinclark.ca/articles/the-journey-to-my-first-ios-app/), Pulls[^1], and a bunch more that have never seen the light of day.

Side projects are a great complement to your normal work. Because the stakes are much lower, side projects can allow you to break some rules, dabble in an area you’re not extremely familiar with and learn a bunch, while your normal work lets you completely master one area. If we take that “T-shaped person” metaphor, side projects should widen the horizontal stroke, while your normal work should make the vertical stroke longer.

I try to keep my side projects pretty open-ended, but I’ve imposed myself two rules for side projects:

1. If you’re not excited to work on your side project or it starts to feel like a burden, don’t feel guilty about not working on it. That’s the beauty of side projects: you decide *what* to work on and *when* to work on them (or not). The goal isn’t to burn yourself out, it’s to have fun doing interesting work.

2. Pick projects that have an end. You don’t want to be stuck maintaining an old side project five years down the road. This will make it impossible for you to do anything new. Being conscious of the time commitment from the beginning is super important in my opinion.

We touched on a few more points [on the podcast][Artboard]. Give it a listen and [let me know what you think!](http://twitter.com/vernalkick)
