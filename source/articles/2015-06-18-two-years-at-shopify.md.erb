I forgot to write about it yesterday, but I've now been at [Shopify](http://shopify.com) for *two years*! Over these last few years, I've made many frienships, I've worked really hard on interesting problems, and I've learned a ton. A year at Shopify really is like 10 years anywhere else. Now imagine what spending *two* years is like!

I'm extremely proud to be a part of this adventure and continue making commerce accessible to more people. Here's to many more years to come!
