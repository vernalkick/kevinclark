I forgot to write about it yesterday, but I've now been at [Shopify](http://shopify.com) for *two years*. These last two years passed so quickly. I have learned so much, made many great friendships and worked on amazing projects that challenged me to become a better designer and I still love it just as much as when I first started (if not more).

I'm extremely proud to be a part of this and get to work with smart, passionate people. Here's to many more years to come.
