I [tweeted about it already](https://twitter.com/vernalkick/status/617362664403156993), but a single tweet isn't enough to express how much I enjoyed [this game][Her Story]. I'm not a gamer[^1]. I have very few games on my iPhone and I rarely download new ones, but if you're like me, you're going to love this one. Describing "[Her Story][Her Story]" as a game almost doesn't do it justice; it's much more like an interactive movie.

By simply typing keywords in a search box, you slowly uncover the mysterious story of a British woman interviewed about her missing husband. Each video giving you a better idea of what happened.

The result is just a fascinating experience that I've never seen in a game before. I can't recommend [this game][Her Story] enough.
